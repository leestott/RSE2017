## RSE 2017 Microsoft Demos and Resources

The RSE are an association working to create a community and raise awareness of the UK’s Research Software Engineers. This github is the set of resources which the Microsoft team presented at the RSE 2017 Conference at Manchester MOSI event.  

## The role of Software in Teaching, Learning & Research

The adoption of the RSE role within academia to support Researchers and Academics in undertaking software based outcomes. 

A key goal for us at Microsoft is to Influence academia to recognise the fundamental role that software plays in today’s teaching, learning and research and ensuring students, academics and support staff have exposure to tools and technologies which will enable this.

## What is a Research Software Engineer?

A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in programming with an intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is extremely valuable, these people lack a formal place in the academic system. This means there is no easy way to recognise their contribution, to reward them, or to represent their views.Without a name, it is difficult for people to rally around a cause, so we created the term Research Software Engineer. We are now working to raise awareness of the role and bring the community together. Some Research Software Engineers start off as researchers who spend time developing software to progress their research. Because they enjoy this work and have invested in developing specialist skills, they continue to focus on software and its use in research. Others start off from a more conventional software-development background and are drawn to research by the challenge of using software to further research.
The attraction of being a Research Software Engineer is similar to that of being a researcher: the role attracts people who want to know how the world works. The Research Software Engineer works with researchers to gain an understanding of the problems they face, and then develops, maintains and extends software to provide the answers. 

The RSE organise regular events to allow Research Software Engineers to meet, exchange knowledge and collaborate.
